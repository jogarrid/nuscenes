# nuscenes
Nuscenes data prediction
For the nuscenes import to work, follow the steps in https://github.com/nutonomy/nuscenes-devkit

As of December 2018, tensorflow is not compatible with python 3.7. Nuscenes, however, only works in python 3.7. Therefore, to be able to use both nuscenes and tensorflow, I constantly switch between two virtual environments, one that has python 3.6 (and therefore tensorflow) and one that has python 3.7 (and therefore nuscenes).
